# SteamGuardDesktop by ShiiroSan #

**Actually this program isn't user friendly for setting up steam guard access.**
**Moreover you'll need a rooted Android phone with Steam apps and SteamGuard fully functional. In future release you'll be able to use this program to make it.**

For now this program will be **Windows only**. 
*Linux might get supported in time but it's not currently planned.* 

## Futures features ##

###Planned###
NB: Version number will be the same as for **developer** and **stable**. Which mean that v0.1 from **stable** will be perfectly like v0.1 from **developer**.
The only changing things is the access to new stuff. You can see **developer** release like an early access feature which can be laggy/not working as attended.

* v0.1 : Working basic console stuff. In other words, you can get the code. Maybe this will be more or less worked.
* v0.2 : Multi-(local)-account support.
* v0.3 : Auto-update stuff.
* v0.4 : Online account syncing.
* v1.0 : Basic GUI stuff. Maybe ImGUI. Maybe .NET. Who know.

###Random stuff I wanna add without taking care of specific version###
These features are only things I think to. Might never be done due to C# isn't my main coding language. 
Of course, some of them can become Planned Features.

* Password encryption for local account / syncing account.
* Accept share/sell from Steam. (This is a big big big feature I'd really like to add)
* Auto sync steam time (shitty things made from Volvo).
* Auto detect Steam UI for asking steamguard code (like done on mobile phone)

And I'm still searching for other things to add. So feel free to send email about it or do a pull requests.

### How do I get set up? ###

Just download .exe file on Debug/Release *(Debug will be more unstable from Release one but can include newer things).*

**Actually you need to create a conf.txt in same dir of .exe file. This file should only contain the shared_secret key.**
